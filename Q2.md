# Documentation for `get_cred_config` Method in `/Raven/raven/client.cpp`

## Method: `get_cred_config`

### Description
The `get_cred_config` method is responsible for creating and initializing a new QUIC credential configuration. It allocates memory for a `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG` structure, sets its values, and returns a pointer to the configured structure. This method ensures the client is configured with proper credentials for secure communication using Microsoft QUIC (msquic).

### Syntax
```cpp
QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG* get_cred_config();
```

### Parameters
This method does not take any parameters.

### Return Value
- Returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG` structure.
- The returned pointer must be freed by the caller to prevent memory leaks.

### Implementation Details
1. Allocates memory for a `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG` structure using `malloc`.
2. Sets all bytes in the structure to zero using `memset`.
3. Initializes the following fields of the structure:
   - `Type`: Set to `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_TYPE_NONE`, indicating no specific credentials.
   - `Flags`: A bitwise OR combination of the following:
     - `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_FLAG_CLIENT`: Marks this as a client credential configuration.
     - `QUIC_CREDENTIAL_FLAG_NO_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATION`: Skips certificate validation for testing or non-secure scenarios.
4. Returns the configured structure.

### Example Usage
```cpp
QUIC_CREDENTIAL_CONFIG* credConfig = get_cred_config();
if (credConfig != nullptr) {
    // Use the credential configuration here.

    // Free the allocated memory after use.
    free(credConfig);
} else {
    std::cerr << "Failed to create credential configuration." << std::endl;
}
```

### Notes
- This method is crucial for initializing the client credential configuration required by `MOQTClient`.
- The `Flags` field disables certificate validation, which may be insecure in production environments. Use with caution.

### Output
This method does not produce direct output but returns a pointer to a configured structure.

### Error Handling
- If memory allocation fails, the method may result in undefined behavior. Ensure proper error handling in calling code.

---

### Larger Code Context: Usage in `main`
In the `main` function, this method is used to set up the credential configuration for the `MOQTClient`:

```cpp
moqtClient->set_CredConfig(get_cred_config());
```
This call ensures that the client has the required credentials to establish a QUIC connection.
